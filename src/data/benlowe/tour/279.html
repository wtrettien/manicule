	<p>This eight-canto poem only takes up just over 30 sheets of this roughly 79-sheet book. At some point, Benlowes decided to write a ninth canto in Latin, “Recapitulatio,” then translated this into English as “The Recapitulation”; it is tacked after Canto 8 in facing-page translation. Even having summarized the poem, he is unwilling to consider <em>Theophila</em> finished. Latin translations of Canto 1 and 3 done by Benlowes’ friend Alexander Ross follow, then there is a previously-unpublished poem by Own Feltham, “Upon the Vanitie of the World” and some more Latin verse. Feltham’s poem launches Benlowes into his own poem, “The Vanitie of the World.” This is a new work, with a new title — Benlowes has shifted away from <em>Theophila</em> and is now addressing his “Headlesse, heady Age” — but nevertheless he numbers the cantos 10 and 11, as if they were continuing the earlier work. Again, the poem ends, this time punctuated with this engraving of a young woman dressed lightly, her hair curled about her ears. She is Hollar’s “Spring Woman,” from the same series as the woman dressed in furs at the beginning of the book, here set on the page with the letterpress. As with the “Winter Woman,” Benlowes uses Hollar’s bright image as an ironic foil to the poem’s final castigation of unchaste women. On several extant copies, Benlowes has even painted the women’s lips pink and tattooed her skin with asterisks, upside crescent moons, dots, and other obscure astrological or typographic marks to her forehead and cheeks in ink, as if to annotate her body with the transcendent geometries — figured in Barlow’s etchings for Cantos 7 and 8 — that she should be contemplating.</p>
